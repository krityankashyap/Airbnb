/**
 * The .sequelizerc file is a configuration file used by the Sequelize CLI to define default options for Sequelize commands, such as db:migrate or db:seed. It allows you to specify settings like the database connection string, paths to migrations and seeders, and the environment to use, without having to pass these options as command-line arguments every time.
